## 🧠 Overview

This project is a full-stack AI-powered image generation app that allows users to generate and apply AI-created textures to a 3D object rendered using Three.js. The application features a modern front end built with Vite + React + Tailwind CSS and a backend using Node.js with Express. AI image generation is powered through API calls (e.g., to OpenAI or similar models).
